# Berkeley CS61A
This is my attempt at Berkeley's CS61A course based on "Structure and interpretation of computer programs".

This includes the homework and projects as well as Brian Harvey's lectures and notes at Berkeley.

Also, why Scheme and not Python? Read: http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/proglang.html
